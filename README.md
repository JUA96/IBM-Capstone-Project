# Peer-graded Assignment: Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhood Data

### This repo contains two projects. 

#### Project 1:
The first notebook is a detailed analysis of Toronto city neighborhoods. Using the four square API, we extracted data on the different neighborhoods in Toronto, we focussed on the different locations of interest such as restuarants, coffee shops and bars. We then clustered the data to find out what the most common types of restuarant/bar were to each neighborhood. 


#### Project 2:
The second notebook explores where in London it would it be best to open a new restuarant. The analysis leverages the four square API to explore different neighborhood's in London. The following questions are answered; what restuarants recieve the best reviews? what restuarants are most popular, and what part of london are they in? Is there a type of restaurant that is consistently more popular than other's? This analysis will help anyone that wants to open up a restaurant in London and wants to know if it is a viable option where they intend on opening.
